	<text>RED GROSS WORK
ORIGINATED FOR
i OF HUMANITY
Ask who founded the Red Cross and
nine persons out of ten will reply con
fidently "Florence Nightingale." As
a matter of fact that noble English
woman and philanthropist, who died
at the use of 90 in 1910, a full of
honors and Rood deeds us of years,
did not found the Rrcat world organ
ization whose mission of mercy has j
been to alleviate the grim hardships !
and horrors of the battlefield. Miss j
XiRhtinRale's work in the Crimean ,
war, however, prepared the way ty its j
stress on humanitarian ideals nml its ,
practical demonstration that the after j
terrors of battle could be alleviated j
by organized and scientific methods. j
The inspiration of a noble American
woman complimented the work of ;he
Ked Cross society, as then conducted
in applying its principles and extend
ing its aid in civilian relief in times of
calamity, pestilence and famine. This
was Clara Burton, born the year after
Mifcs Nightingale and surviving her by
two years The Ked Cross branches
in all countries signatory to the con
vention of Geneva now respond bene
ficently at the call of distress both
in war and peace.
Florence Nightingale was jparly in
terested in nursing and hospital con
ditions. Frightful conditions among
the wounded in previous wars oused
her pity and at the outbreak ot the
Crimean war in JS54 she determine!
to put into practice the theories which
had developed in her mind during an
apprenticeship served in nursing with
the Sisters of St. Vincent do Paul In
Farls and at the Kaisersworth institu
tion on the Rhine. She organized a
hospital department at Scutari, the
eminent success of which proved the
Justice of her claim that war was un
necessarily cruel and which pave her j
worldwide fame. During the civil i
war in this country and tho Franco
Prussian war she was frequently con
sulted by the authorities and rendered
substantial aid. Her humanitarian KH-als backed by
extraordinary efficiency made the
world receptive for the project of
Jean Henri Dunant, a philanthropic
citizen of Switzerland. He w,as pres

Naval Warfare.
This conflict, however, by its dis
turbance of peace conditions, militat
?d against inclusion of additional pow
ers and responsibilities. In 1869 the

the inability of the regular surgical
corps to cope with demands made on
it. Limited in numbers and not well
organized or provided with facilities,
the doctors and nurses could not care
properly for the thousands of wound
ed. His observations and his knowl
edge of the ideals of mercy, turned
into reality by Florence Nightingale,
led to the writing of "Un Souvenir de
Solferino," in which he graphically
described the horrors that had shock
ed his eye and stirred his pity. Hut
it was more than a medley of horrors;
it was a constructive document.
Dunnnt suggested that all nations
form societies for the training of
nurses and the accumulation of sup
plies for immediate use on the out
break of future wars. He was really
the forerunner of "preparedness." His
propfosal was cordially received by
the Society of Public Vtalitv of Oe-
neva, which started an agitation that
led to an international conference, Oc
tober, 1863, followed by another in
August of the following year, com
posed of authorized diplomatic repre
sentatives of sixteen nations.
The Geneva convention, signed Au
gust 22, 1864, was the fruit of the
conferences. The Geneva convention,
which has become a part of interna
tional law by the acceptance of the
original and later signatory nations,
makes no provision for tho organiza
tion we know as the Red Cross, con
trary to usual belief. The first con
ference, however, formulated an
agieement that each country which
signed the convention should havo a
r.atlpnal society, civil in nature arid
functions, to be vested with the sole
right to authorize the dispatch of a
surgical corps and to establish field
hospitals in case of wars- Fourteen
nations ratified the convention imme
diately and the number of signatories
is now close to fifty, virtually the en-

met in Paris to make revisions found
desirable and necessary out of expe
rience. It proposed several supple
mentary articles, including the exten
sion of Red Cross principles to naval
Harfare. These were formally pro
posed to the signatories by a diplo- I
mfttic congress at (Jeneva in 1870, but
were never binding, as the Frussian
drive into France prevented ratifica
tion. The Hague peace conference
ot 1899 finally brought naval warfare
into the scope of the Red Cross. Other
subjects have bee discussed at the
quinquennial conferences in various
capitals. The relation of the Red
Cross to army organization has been
worked out, and measures taken to
impress on the soldier the meaning of
the insignium and the necessity of
respecting it. One of the chief sub
jects of discussion was of methods for
preventing abuse of the emblem in
cloaking hostile designs; this came up
particularly at tho time of the Boer
war.
Amplification of scopo has been
blocked by the fact that the confer
ences cannot make their recommenda
tions mandatory. To be written into
International law they must be rati
fied by all the signatory nations. The
various national committees or "so
cletles are not internationally linked,
but the one at Geneva Js accepted as
the central body in matters of an
nouncing policy and conducting inter
national negotiations.
The American Red Cross.
The American National Red Cross
society was formed in 1881 by Clara
Barton, long a humanitarian and with
a glowing record as a civil war nurse.
The L'nited States ratified the Geneva
convention the next year. Miss Bar

	<text>Keeping Pershing's Army in Good Spirits
Henry P. Davison, Chairman of the Red Cross War Council, Explains the Way Our Soldiers
Are Informed Truthfully of Home Conditions
i
P u cross section photograph could be
taken to-day o the activities of tno
American lied Cross, both at home and
abroad, the resultant picture would be
a great comfort to every woman who has
a husband or brother, father or son, en
listed in Amerira's fighting forces. Por
it would show a scope of endeavor far
greater than the original function of the
lied Cross, which was merely to care for
the wounded. The wounded still get at
tention, all that the best doctors ani
nurses can give them; hut that is only one
phase of the work that the American Red
Cross now 83-mbolizes. The rest of the
picture is new.
In this new picture, which has been en
larged to meet the demands of modern
warfare, the flag of the American Red
Cross Hies over every camp and canton
ment "where American men nro being
trained for battle, symbolizing a protec
tion to their morale as well as thrir crea
ture comforts. It flies beside canteens
and rest houses, hospitals and prison
camps. And to each of these places it
brings the assurance that the American
people stand behind their lighting men.
Hut that is not all.
The Red Crou Flag.
The same flag with the Stars anrt
Stupes floating beside it waves over huge
warehouses in France and Italy, visual
izing the American spirit that Oiled those
warehouses with food, clothing and meu
ical supplies for the French and Italians.
It flies over similar warehouses in the war
torn countries of our smaller Allies. It
hangs from the windows of the new liitls
homes that are springing up in the re
claimed sections of France and Belgium.
'To understand the significance of this
combination campaign which the Amer
ican Red Cross is waging both at home and
abroad." said Henry P. Davison, chair
man of the American Red Cross "War
Council, in an interview with a represen
tative of Tub Sunday Sun, "one has
merely to glance back at one of the earli
est lessons learned by our Al
lies. The first year of the war
rught them that it takes some
thing more than guns and military train
ing to mako a good fighter. The 'some-,
thing more' needed was morale, and mo
rale disappeared when worry over home
troubles appeared in the trenches.
Giving the New of Home.
"The American Red Cross representa
tives abroad provide homes tor the home
less, food for the hungry, care and medi
cine for the sick, of France and Belgium.
Coincident almost with the start of this
work the morale of the Frcueh and Bel
gian armies improved, for good news
leaches the men at the front almost as
rapidly us the bad.
"With this first hand evidence before
them of the value of keeping a soldiers
mind free from the care uud worry inci
dent to bail news from home, both the Red
Cro. and the War Department of this
eouutry agreed that similar care should
be taken of American soldiers, only they
decided to start it earlier.
"As a result, in every training camp
and cantonment in this country to-day as
well as in the American camps abroad,
the American Red Cross has established
a bureau of camp service comprising an
associate director, a director of hospital
service and as many assistants as are
necessary. These men are authorized to
do everything possible for the comfort
and welfare of the soldiers and to respond
to all requests for that service Unit are
approved by the commanding officers of
the camp in which they are stationed.</text>

	<text>How Was the Last War Fund Spent?
IT is a fair question—and it is fairly answered in the
1 detailed and itemized reports that have been pub
lished in the newspapers of every town and city of
the land.
You never saw it? Then ask at the nearest Red
Cross Chapter, or write, for the Red Cross wants you
to know where your money went.
They say that Red Cross supplies have a way of
coming through on time.
Italy surely has found us riot wanting in prompt
ness when her great trial came.
And Roumania—they said no allied nation could
get through to help her dire need.
But the Red Cross found a way.
It's not always û cheap way—"Needs must"
costs money. But did you give that money to be
saved —or to save lives? Are you not willing to pay
five dollars or fifty to bring something of comfort to
a war racked, tortured mortal who but for'you would
surely die?
And of one thing you may be sure. Not one
penny of that Hundred Million has gone for anything
but War Relief
In the Red Cross there is no high salaried bureau
cracy, no extravagant administration expense. All of
the higher officials and nine-tenths of the workers are
unpaid volunteers.
The cost of raising and collecting the last War
Fund was about one-half of one per cent., more than
covered by the banking interest on the money.
Your Red Cross needs another hundred million to
lighten just a little of the awful load of misery "over
there." Your share is ail that you can give—and
then a little more.
Will you hold up your end?</text>

	<text>The Spending of Your
Hundred Million Dollars
Busiest Budget in All the World Is a Red
Cross War Fund—Every Dollar Spent
Alleviates Misery.
Last summer the public subscribed
a hundred million dollars to the Ited
Cross. At the latest statement over
eighty-five millions of it had been ap
propriated.
Where has it goneî you ask. For
many months the world has been
spending over a hundred million dol
lar* a day for the destruction of life,
limb and means of subsistence. Call
up what you have read about the war's
devastation. The American Ited Cross'
enormous job Is to do whatever it can
to alleviate that—not after the war,
not after governments have deliber
ated and resolved ; but right now, at
the minute, on the spot. It's amazing
that it has done so much with so little
money.
I^ist autumn the Italian army fell
back precipitately. On your war map!
that meant rubbing out one line and
drawing another half an inch further I
south. Over there In Italy It meant
thousands of poor families fleeing from,
their homes. Major Murphy, Red |
Cross Commissioner in Europe, rushed j
to the scene and wired : "Indescribably j
pathetic conditions exist, involving j
separation of mothers and children,
cold, hunger, disease, death." In No-j
vember and December the American
Red Cross appropriated three million
dollars for relief there—a large sum,
yet small in comparison with the need.
Condensed Milk for Children.
Soldiers are only a part of the Red
Cross' work—probably the smaller
part Every instant, somewhere in the
vast flood of destruction, a hand I
rasches up In appeal. It Is pretty apt!
to be a child's hand or a woman's.;
When the Red Cross commission j
reached Petrograd It asked the gov- j
«rament, "What Is the meet argent

thing?" The government replied : "We
must get condensed milk for the little
children here." The commission got
the milk. At one spot In France farm
work was stopped by lack of horses.
That meant more hunger. The Red
Cross got In a big tractor and set it
to plowing for the community.
There are a million needs. Cold,
wet and the deadly physical strain of
the trenches undermine men's consti
tutions. A frightful scourge of tuber
culosis has developed In France. The
Red Cross has built sanatoria, pro
vided over a thousand beds and nurses.
Thirty Millions for France.
I have here a big sheaf of sheets
filled with figures. One Item is thirteen
million and odd dollars—the amount
which, up to that time, had gone to the
local chapters of the Red Cross in the
United States for local relief. Twenty
five per cent of the money subscribed
through the chapters eventually goes
that way.
Over thirty millions have been ap
propriated for work in France. Here
is a million and a quarter—in round
numbers—for military hospitals and
dispensaries; over a million and a half
for canteen service, where French and
American soldiers, relieved from the
trenches, can get good food, a cot, n
hath, and have their clothes disinfected
—and so go on for their brief holiday
clean, rested, nourished. There are
over three millions for hospital supply
service; half a million for rest sta
tions for American troops.
Aid of refugees—eleven thousand
families—accounts for nearly three
million dollars; care and prevention of
tuberculosis takes over two millions;
care of helpless children over a mil
lion; relief work 1» six devastated dis

tricts, including care of five thousand
families and sufficient reconstruction
to make houses habitable, required
over two millions.
Misery on an Unparalleled Scale.
These are all large items; but the
Red Cross Is grappling with human
misery on an unparalleled scale—a
world of it. The item for relief of the
blind amounts to four hundred thou
sand dollars. The dispensary service
sends supplies to more than thirty-four
hundred hospitals. The Red Cross re
ceives and distributes more than two
hundred tons of supplies daily at Pai ls.
For this distribution and its other
work it requires a big transportation
service of motors and trucks. This
transportation service has cost a mil
lion and a half, and Its operating ex
penses run to a million dollars.
Every dollar it spends means misery
alleviated. Its work Is building abroud
for the United States the best good will
in this world. It is building the best
good will among ourselves. Whatever
else the war may produce, we shall be
proud of our Red Cross.</text>

	<text>Babe Ruth Is Lucky to Get Off So Easily After Hittimj Umpire
FAR be It from ua to wish any guy haid luck, but It appears that Babo Ruth
escftpefl too easily after his fight with Umplro Owens on tho ball field. Ban
Johnson dismissed the matter with a flno of $100 nnd a suspension of ono week.
This does not seem enough, nnd It Is certain that a player of less lmportanro
would have been treated rather harshly. Ruth is one of tho stars of tho lcaguo .
and a prolonged nbsenco would havo ruined Boston's pennant chances. Also tho
gate receipts would have suffered. So Bnttllns Ban beenme as meek ns a lamb
and decided to "give the boy another chance."
The bad feature of this case Is that It will cnconrago others to pull tho same
Btuff. A week's layoff nnd $100 fine Is nice, gentle punishment, nnd tho chances
are that some playora would pay twice as much for a shot at nn umpire's Jaw.
It cost McGraw $500 for punching Byron under tho grnnd stand nnd Ruth'a of
fense was more flagrant thnn that. Ban seems to havo mado another mistake.
Ho should, have used Ruth ns a horrlblo example and soaked him with a long
layoff and a healthy tine.</text>

BABE RUTH LIKELY TO DRAW PENALTY FOR EFFORT TO PROTECT HIMSELF
WASHINGTON TIMES SPORTS
FRIDAY, MAY 26, 1922.
F
Suspension Likely for Ruth,
But Incident Draws Attention
to Fans' Cowardice.
By lolls A. HOLGHKR.
Babe Ruth is likely to he pun
ished severely for entering the
grandstand at the Polo Grounds,
New York, and seeking to ham
mer an insulting fan. There are
two sides to every question and
the ball player has an excellent
argument to offer in partial pal
liation of his offense.
Ban Johnson is expected to sus
pend the Yankees' home-run hit
ter for ten days. He may impose
a heavy fine on the player. But
Ban Johnson will do the game a
great good if he will investigate
conditions surrounding the inci
dent at the Polo Grounds.
It Is admitted that Babe Ruth
ov?rratepped the hounds on the play
ing field when, called out stretching
his single, he tossed a handful of
dirt at Umpire Hildebrand. He wps |
ejected from the game for that, then ?
and there.
It is admitted that Ruth commiited
a cardinal offense when he lef the I
playing field and sought to beat up |
one of his insulters. He is vet to.
be punished for that.</text>

	<text>Babe Ruth Hits 28th Homer,
Ball Clearing Roof of Stand
Longest Drive Ever Seen Under Shadow of Coogan's
Bluff Ties Up Game in Ninth, but Yankees Come
Through With a Winning Counter in Thirteenth
By W. 0. McGeehan
Babe Ruth, of the Boston Red Sox, broke all home run records at
, the Polo Grounds in the ninth inning of the second game with the Yankees.
His twenty-eighth home run for tho season cleared the top of the right field
grandstand, the longest hit that was ever seen since the days when the
goats roamed Coogan's Bluff and even before that. Numerically it places
Ruth's home run record one beyond the twenty-seven achieved by Ed
Williamson in 1884.
The blow came in the ninth inning,
with thfe Yanks leading by one run in
a tight pitching duel between young
Waito Hoyt and Bob Shawkey, of the

Georsre Herman Ruth, better known as Battering Babe Ruth, prin

ha world an insight into his peculiar brain procesa?if you will admit
e possesses a brain. Incidentally, hie speech shows him to be quite in
ccord with many others who think little of their plighted faith. Though
;? has two more years to complet? his contract ?with the Boston Red
ex at a salary of $10,000 yearly. Ruth would sign a new one calling
?7T $20,000 yearly. Furthermore, he says he will not play with the Boe
ra club unless his wishes are granted.
. Last spring Ruth held out until the last minute. He wanted a
alary of $15,000, if our memory be correct, but finally compromised by
?ft?ing a three-year-contract calling for a salary of $10,000 yearly. All
oat took place before he began hammering home runs until he had
Token ail previous big league records for this stunt. He admitted that
e was satisfied with the treatment given him by both Harry Frazee and
Jd Barrow. He proved it by playing fine ball all season. But Babe has
'?gtened to -erpent tongues. Now he would quit playing ball unless the
?oston club agrees to make a new contract calling for $20,000 a year.</text>

Yankees Buy Babe Ruth
From Boston for $125,000
Manhattan Tribe Purchase Home Run Slug
ger From Hub City Team in Biggest Deal
In History of Baseball.
Boston, Jan. 5.?"Babe" Ruth, world champion home-run player
of the Red Sox, has been bought by the New York Yankees, ac
cording to an announcement made tonight. Harry H. Frazee, owner
of the Red Sox, who told of the sale of Ruth, declined to name the
price paid, but declared it was larger than had ever before been paid.
The deal was said to have involved no other players.
Estimates, unofficial, but said to have been based upon "inside
information," placed the figure at which "Babe" Ruth was told at
,the unprecedented sum of $125,000. Efforts to have this estimate
substantiated or denied failed, but it was generally reported that the
figure was not far from correct.
Highest Figure Yet Paid.
If the estimate proves accurate, the sale of Ruth not only ele
vates the trading of baseball players to inclusion in the category of
sugar, shoes, clothing and other high-priced necessities, but records
a sale at more than double the highest price heretofore paid for
a player.</text>

ever, the Bull Mm 1 ravelled Far Beyond the Fielders' Reach and "Babe" Ruth Hat Scored Another Home Run
By Prof. A. L. Hodges,
The Wc!l-Knnivn Phyticitt.
AST Mason "I'.abe" Ruth broke all
baseball records by hitting twenty*
nine homo runs. Ar.l this season
there is every indication that ho will beat
his 11*10 total by a wide margin.
What is tho se ret of Ruth's ability to
make home runs with such surprising fre
quency? "?; it because he Is possessed of
greater strength than his fellow players?
Is it because his vision is keener or his
museles better ca-ordinated?
All these tilings doubtless have some
thing to lo with it, but the real reason for
thl:- iii.yionn'nal series of home runs sci
i nee finds to be the way Xvitlx applies to
his work with the bat certain well-known
principles of physics and psychology.
"But." you say. "Iluth Is a ball plavor.
What does ho know of physics or psy
chology?"
Notheing, perhaps, but whether con
sciou.ly or unconsciously Ruth applies
certain well-known principles of these two
sciences every time ho makes a homo run.
Let us consider some of the many inter
rsting scientific factors involved in bat
t itig a ball.
As very follower of baseball knows, a
home run is the knocking of the ball out
of the reaoli of opposing players and in
.r.uch a direction and to nuch a distance as
o make its return impossil'o before th?
runner completes the circuit of the bases.
Viewed as n mechanical proolem. the hit
ting of a home run moans simply hitting
ti ball with the bat so as to give it great
speed in the proper direction. The spe^l
and direction which the bat can To made to
give tilt; ball depend on the degree of tin
curve which tlio pitcher has imparted to
the ball, the weight of the ball, the. weight
of the bat, the elasticity of the ball and
bat. and the angle at which tin, ball iir
pinges on the bat.
The speed which a ball t * es on im
mediately after its collision w'th the bat
is a little difficult to compete because
neither the bat nor the ball is perfectly
elastic or perfectly non-elaaMc. To illus
trate tlio difficulty of such a o mputation
let mo explain what happens when per
fectly elastic and perfectly non-elastic
bodies come into collision.
If two inelastic bodies?say two pieces
of lead?of equal weight and going with
equal speed, but in opposite directions
meet squarely "in mid-air, they will both
stop and fall to the ground, all theii
energy of motion having been turned into
heat. If, however, perfectly elastic bodler
of the same weight going with the same
velocity, but in opposite directions, mee?
in mid-air, they will bounce back with
the same velocity they had originally. 11
one of these bodies has twice the velocity
of the other, the latter will bounce back
with twice its original velocity and tho
former will bounce back only half as fast.
All this applies to bodies having tho same
weight. Whenever one of the colliding
bodies is heavier than- the other, the ve
locity given tho latter body upon bouncing
is enormously increased.
The bat which "Rabe" Ruth wields and
the ball which he hits are both fairly clas
tic; therefore, everything else being equal,
the ball will be driven farther the heavier
the bat and the faster the bat is moving
as it hits the ball. Also, as tho weight of
"Halm" Ruth's body prevents his bat from
doing much bouncing back, tho faster the
ball corner, the farther It will go when ho
hits it.
The weight of tho ball Itself is a very
important factor in hitting a homo run,
viewed us a scientific problem. If thero

were no atmosphere, everytliine be
ing equal, the lighter tne Dall happened to
ho the farther it would go. The friction of
the air. however, slows the ball up con
siderably, and this fact has to bo taken
into consideration with several others.
The conclusion which science reaches Is
that the heavier tho ball is, without In
creasing its size or decreasing Its elas
ticity, tho farther it will go after being
struck with tho bat.
The direction taken by a batted ball is
affected to some extent by the rotation of
tho ball as it strikes the bat. Thi3 factor
is of the neatest importance when the
but does not strike tho ball squarely.
It is possible for the hat to hit the ball
in such a way that it actually increases the
latter's rotation. In other words, it is per
fectly possible for the batter to hit tho
ball in such a way that it takes on a de
cided curve. Everybody who plays golf
knows what a common occurrence this is
on the links. A golf hall when struck acci
dentally oft' centre will ofton describe the
weirdest imaginable path through the air,
particularly if it passes through various
air currents.
A honr n depends to a very large ex
tent up> ? direction given the batted
ball. T ' ortanco of this factor 'may
he estimated a- nine times that of tho
speed given the hat*~d ball. 13y direction
we mean not only the horizontal angle, but
also the vertical angle at which tho ball
leaves the hat. For example, no matter
how hard the ball is hit, it will never re
sult in a home run unit's .t clears the
upstretched arms of the p1 ?yers in tho
field.
It is plain that the direction given
the butted ball must depend to a largo
extent upon the manner in which the ball
is travelling before it meets tho bat. Pro
vided the ball is given a proper rota
tion on its horizontal axis by the pitcher,
the kind of curve best suited to make it
difficult to hit it at the proper vertical
angle is either tho down shoot or the up
shoot. On account of the many variablo
factors concerned science believes that any
home run made with either of theso curve3
is a lucky chance pure and simple.
After the ball has boon set in motion by
the bat with a certain speed, tho distance
it will go depends upon the vertical angle
at which it starts. The most desirable
angle i3 one of 12 degrees with the ground,
or about half a right angle. Other factors
which determine the distance a batted ball
will travel are the speed of the ball, its
sphericity, the smoothness of its surface
and its lack of rotation. Tho greater tho
speed of the ball tho more perfectly
spherical it is. tho smoother its surface
and the less rotation with which it travels
the farther it will go. Atmospheric con
ditions, of course, enter into tho problem.
A ball will go farther in a clear air that is
free from moisture. Tho wind may carry
it bodily for quite a distance or may retard
its progress.
If science wore asked to make it difficult
or well-nigh impossible for "Babe" Kutli to
Ltit a home run it would select a day w.ien
tho barometer was high, with the air so
heavy with moisture that it would retard
the progress of tho batted ball. Iho
pitcher selected would be one good on very
alow but curvy downshootfl. If such a
pitcher were not available, one who hid
euch great speed that lie couid put any
kind of a ball over the plato for tho
batter would bo chosen. With this
hind of a pitcher the ball is likely to
be hit behind the plate and unlikely to bo
started on its course at the proper angle.
His hitting of a homo run could then bo
mado stHI more difficult by compelling the
redoubtable "Babe" to use a bat either so
heavy that he could not swing it with much
speed, or so light that it would tend to hit
tho ball at tho wrong horizontal angle.
There is a certain spot on the bat, usu
ally a few inches from tho end. but vary
ing with dlfVerent bats, which science
knows as the centre of percussion. If the
ball hits the bat exactly on this spot tho
greatest effect is produced. All ball play
ers are aware when the ball hits this spot
on the bat, not only through the absence
of jar to the arm, but also through a pecul
iar satisfaction which is hard to define,
but which is no doubt physical as well as
mentnl.</text>

	<text>"Did Babe Ruth Get Another One To-day?"
| Not "How Did the Game Come Out?"
*| Now the Great American Question 4
By W? O. McGeehan
IF THE lata lamented Shakes?
peare were a' baseball writer he
might usa a line that he
wested upon some more or less
obscure hero of antiquity and say of
"Babe" Ruth, "He doth bestride the
narrow baseball fields like a Colos?
sus." For "Babe" Ruth is Hercules
and Thor reincarnated, the Colossus
of Swat. His bat is the club of
Hercules and the hammer of Thor,
the symbol of sheer, primitive might
before which the puny folk bow and
offer worship.
But for the game of baseball, the
youngest game of the youngest peo?
ple, George Herman Ruth, the
"Babe" Ruth who dwarfs all other
personalities in the daily news,
might have been a peaceful cigar
maker or perhaps a third-rate
heavyweight pugilist instead of the
national idol of the American people.
The "Babe" was Fortune's dar?
ling, though Fortune concealed her
great and kindly intentions as far as
he was concerned when the "Babe"
was 2. boy. For the "Babe" was
born left-hander!. Hercules was a
right-hander. Thor never was pic?
tured as wielding his hammer from
the port side. None of the heroes of
antiquity, as far as can be ascer?
tained, was a southpaw. Harry Leon
Wilson was the first novelist to put a
left-hander in the near-hero class,
and he i;d it in a half-hearted
fashion.</text>

ANEW record in the history of
western athletics was made yes
terday by runners in the Los An
geles to Venice Marathon race, given
under the auspices of the Los Angeles
Athletic club.
The race is distinctly the classic
athletic event of the coast. Eleven of
the twenty-three racers participating
lowered the former record, and George
B. Miller, winner of yesterday's con
test, covered the distance of 15% miles
in 1 hour and 41 seconds, a record which
future runners will find it difficult to
lower.
Miller's success was a surprise to all,
as no one had selected him as a likely
winner, and his name did not appear
among those who had been picked by
enthusiasts as probable winners. In
fact, he had not expected to win, and
had entered the race only to see what
he could do.
Finishing strong at the tape, Miller
did not seem to be much tired. Clad
in his running clothes, he conversed
with admiring spectators, while others
who had participated were being helped
tj dressing rooms where medical as
sistance was rendered.
Miller is a carpenter and lives at 749
San Julien street, Los Angeles. He is
26 years old and married. It is by mere
chance he entered the race. He was
urged by W. Burness, his trainer an-i
a man of many years' experience in
racing circles, to compete. Burness
had observed the young man had shown
great endurance when they went into
the country for tramps over the hills,
and he urged him to enter the race.
Miller is not a runner, never had taken
part in a race and had been trained
for a month only. This training he
did after working- hours, for he had
been engaged regularly at his trade
up to the time of the race. He n^ver
had run more than ten miles at one
time previous to the contest of yester
day.
Miller did not want to enter the race
because he had no running shoes and
because he thought he had no chance
to win; but his trainer persisted and
so he listed his name, saying he would
"just try it and see if he could stay
with the runners for a few miles."
Surpasses Expectations
Many persons thought the former
record of 2:01:30, made by Edward
Dietrich in September, would be low
ered ten minutes in yesterday's con
test. A few even ventured to assert
they thought it would be lowered fif
teen minutes. No one was so opti
mistic 2« to suggest that twenty min
utes would be taken from the estab
lished record. Miller lowered the rec
or 1 twenty minutes and thirty seconds
surpassing the most liberal predic
tions.
Miller averaged 6 minutes and 45
seconds a mile for the entire distance
The first four runners averaged better
than 7 minutes a mile. Considering the
condition of the course and the dis
tance, this is a remarkable record. Five
minutes is not considered slow time for
a mile run on a cinder path, where
contestants use spiked running shoes.

mODAY on the course at the Polo
grounds, New York city, will be
run that mwl all atn
letie events, the international Mara
thon, this will be the greatest race of
its kind yet run. There is a purse of
$10,; I for Which long distance runners
from nil over the world will compete.
This is another proof of the prevalence
of Marathonltla, a disease that tirst
affected the Grwks nearly B0 years be
fore the beginning: of the Christian era.
and which has recently obtained a se
cure grip on Americans in a manner
without precedent in the annals of
amateur sport on this hemisphere.

Hayes, a compara
tively lesser light In
athletic circle* ir
New York, carried
the Stars and
Stripes to victory
by winning the
Marathon in the re
newal of the an
cient Olympic
games In the Lon
don stadium in
1908, he not only
achieved everlast
ing glory for him
self, but caused a
renewal of interest
in lons distance
running the like of
which America has
never known.
Since the triumph
of Hayes nearly
every city in this
country has had
Marathon races.
While it was gen
erally conceded that
the team from the
F. J. Haskln
United States would score an over
whelming victor. In th matter of
points at the Olympiad, there was little
deep rooted confidence in the ability
of the Americans to carry off premier
honors in the most coveted race on the
program. For years field and track
sports of all sorts had been enjoying
a healthful development in this country,
but the improvement in the class or
long distance runners had been so
gradual that it was hardly considered
likely that any American would bo able
to successfully match strides with the
stars representing the nations that had
for cent ries made an especial effort
to foster long distance running.
In the hope of at least making a
creditable showing in the Marathon,
several Americans went to the murk.
The result Is history—Dorando failing
in sight of the goal, while Hayes sped
to victory. It was not until the eighties
that American trac* athletes pitted
themselves against the English, Myers
and Merrill In 1881 being pioneers in
the movement that had its culmination
in Hayes' achievement.
While one of the oldest events on the
athletic card, the Marathon race was
almost forgotten until the revival of
the ancient games In an International
athletic contest in Athens in 1896. These
contests were held in the restored sta
dium that had existed before 330 B. C,
toward whose first erection patriotic
citizens had contributed everything
from the gold of one to the thousand
yoke of oxen that another gave, and
whose seats were covered with marble
si bs by Herodius as a gift to the Pan
athenaic festival. Time and war and
forgetfulness had burled the stadium,
but in 1863 Tit was partially excavated,
and before these international contests
it had been restored to Its original de
sign, the underground chambers for the
athletes being the same as when first
used 2000 years before.
There the first athletic Marathon
race was run in memory of that his
toric day 2276 years before, when one
Phllippides, an Athenian soldier, ran
from the plains of Marathon to the
palace In Athens to tell the kins of
the victory of Miltiades and his Atheni
an and Platean freemen over the mer
cenaries of Dar'.us. The runner dropped
dead at the feet of his ruler, so history
and tradition assert. The city accord
ed him every civil and military honor,
his body lying in state In the capitol
for three days. Among the most an
cient pieces of sculpture is that of the
dying Marathon runner.
Marathon lies on the northeast const
of Attica. There the worshp of Apollo
had its first homo, and the district
'boasts that Hercules was first wor
shiped there. On the battlefield is a
mound, or soroa. where the 192 Athenian
dead were hurled nfter the battle. It
was from this historic place that the
course of a novel race was laid out in
1896. a course that followed as near
as history coul*. show the path taken
by Phlllppides, and measuring twenty
six miles and 385 yards. On the day
of the new Marathon the king of the
Greeks was to receive the runner as
did his predecessor, though this time
SO 000 people waited, knowing, 'for the
coming of many runners. Tl.~ fact that
the runner was Splros Louces, son of a
peasant of Attica, brought forth the
greatest applause of the whole contest,
and enthusiastic chroniclers aver that
the great shout rolled" off against Mount
Pentelllcus on the one side and Mount
Hymettus on another as did the joy
ous acclamations of tha people of
twenty-two centuries before.
Marathon races had little hold on
popularity after this until the London
event last year, though it was hoped
at the time of the Buffalo exposition
that the stadium erected there might
remain permanently and the Marathon
run then under such climatic difficul
ties would become a big event In future
athletics. Hayes 1 winning acted as an
inspiration to the athletes of America,
and clubmen, schoolboys and college
students Immediately took to distance
running, which, even now, is complete
ly overehadowlng in publl favor track
contests at shorter distances.</text>
